New paper [On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539){:target="\_blank"} posted on arXiv. <br>
We develop a theoretical understanding of RLVR optimization dynamics by introducing the Gradient Gap, which characterizes convergence directions and sharp step-size thresholds underlying stability and failure.
