New paper [Ask, clarify, optimize: Human-LLM agent collaboration for smarter inventory control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00121){:target="\_blank"} posted on arXiv. <br>
We position LLMs as intelligent collaborators rather than replacements for operations research, enabling effective human–LLM coordination for inventory control through structured agentic design.
