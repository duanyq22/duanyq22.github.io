New paper [Don't waste mistakes: Leveraging negative RL-groups via confidence reweighting
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08696){:target="\_blank"} posted on arXiv. <br>
We show that negative groups in RLVR can be exploited without extra supervision by reinterpreting MLE as a policy gradient with confidence-weighted penalties, leading to the LENS algorithm.
