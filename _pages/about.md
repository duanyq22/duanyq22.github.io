Welcome to my homepage!
I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Technology, Operations, and Statistics](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/ioms-dept) at Stern School of Business at New York University. 
My primary research interests lie in machine learning, particularly statistical aspects of reinforcement learning.

I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at Princeton University in 2022. From 2022 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with Professor [Martin J. Wainwright](https://computing.mit.edu/martin-wainwright/){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to my doctoral studies, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University.
